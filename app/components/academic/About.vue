              Hello, my name is Yunhao Li, and I am currently serving as a
              research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I am
              fortunate to work under the esteemed guidance of
              <a
                class="text-[--el-color-primary]"
                href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0058478"
              >Prof. Qiong Wang</a>. My academic
              journey commenced at Guangzhou University, where I
              pursued and obtained my Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial
              Intelligence. During this enriching period, I was mentored by
              <a
                class="text-[--el-color-primary]"
                href="https://pangyan.me/"
              >Assoc. Prof. Yan Pang </a>, whose invaluable insights
              and expertise have profoundly shaped
              my perspective and skills in the field. Prior to my Masterâ€™s
              degree, I also completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science
              at Guilin University of Electronic Technology, further solidifying
              my foundation in the realm of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research interests focused on Computer Vision, Medical Image
              Analysis, and Multimodal Learning. I am deeply committed to
              harnessing the power of these technologies to make meaningful
              impact on the world. My ultimate aspiration is to contribute to
              the medical science, thereby enhancing human health.
